# Answer the following questions (in the text field):
- What is the minimum number of test cases required to achieve branch coverage in gcd1 and gcd2, respectively?
- Provide a minimal test-suite that achieves branch coverage of gcd1!
- Does that test-suite achieve branch coverage of gcd2?
- In general: does any test-suite that achieves branch coverage for gcd2 also achieve branch coverage for gcd1? If yes, argue why. If not, provide a test-suite that achieves branch coverage for gcd2 but not for gcd1!
